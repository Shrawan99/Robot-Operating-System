# COSYS-ROS-PKG ```version 0.0.1```
is a ros package for collaborative wheelchair systems. It is being developed for a smart powered wheelchair operating within a smart home setting.

With this project we specially aim to recycle powered wheelchairs and plugin add-on modules to them to make them useful for someone with cognitive defecits. Our system could benefit wheelchair users who need assistive powered wheelchairs in their residence to help them with activities of daily living.

The wheelchair is equipped with low cost sensors:
 
1. Microsoft Kinect
2. Incremental Encoders
3. Inertial Measurement Unit
4. Dynamixel Servo Motors for Pan-Tilt Unit
5. Android Device for User Interface

It runs on embedded linux platform on: Nvidia Jetson TK1

A remotely located server computer takes care of computationally intensive task. This computer is designed as a central hub that controls intelligent features of a smart home as well as the powered wheelchair.

TO DO:
Add description intelligent sensors within the smart home.
